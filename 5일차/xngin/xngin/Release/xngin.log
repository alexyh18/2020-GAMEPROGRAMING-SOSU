C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.18362.0\ucrt\tgmath.h(27): warning UCRT4000: The Universal CRT implementation of tgmath.h does not conform to the C99 standard. Functionality equivalent to the type-generic functions provided by tgmath.h is available in <ctgmath> when compiling as C++. If compiling in C++17 mode or higher (/std:c++17), this header will automatically include <ctgmath> instead. You can define _CRT_SILENCE_NONCONFORMING_TGMATH_H to acknowledge that you have received this warning.
