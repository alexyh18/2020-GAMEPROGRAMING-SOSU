You don't know why I'm upset, neither do I
I'm fine if you'll let me be alone when I cry
I never really talk much, keep it inside
To find someone who cares is getting harder to find
We should be dancing in the sun
It's hard when everything is numb
I'd like to try and feel okay
So if I call what would you say?
Hello, hello, hello, oh-oh
Hello, hello, hello, oh-oh
H-hello
H-hello
I like the way my bedsheets look on your body
Tippin' off Molly with your hand on my throat
I get sick of affection and then I get distant
I start getting lifted then I'm fine on my own
If I dial your number, don't pick up the phone
Even if you're alone, it feels like nobody's home
Well I'm only a lover, not really the type
That your mama would like
Can barely handle myself
We should be dancing in the sun
It's hard when everything is numb
I'd like to try and feel okay
So if I call what would you say?
Hello, hello, hello, oh-oh
Hello, hello, hello, oh-oh
H-hello
H-hello
H-hello
H-hello
